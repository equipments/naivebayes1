# naivebayes1
the scripts reducer_senti4.py, mapper_senti.py, run_senti2.sh are a set of scripts to build a map-reduce program to do the naive bayes classification on sentiment of twitter tweets. The reducer_senti4.py is the main script

why I used naive bayes classifier:

the algorithm is relatively easy to implement and the classification accuracy rate is relatively high
